Need some documentation!

More commands...
- truncate store (per-graph delete)

Maybe separate release...
- query endpoints

Would introduce dep on RDF::Query, so separate release...
- query store
- query files/URIs
- parse/explain SPARQL queries

Another release...
- generate RSA keys
- sign RDF
- verify RDF
- encrypt RDF
- decrypt RDF
- sign/verify manifest
